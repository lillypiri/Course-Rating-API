#### Project 11

## Course Rating API 📚

###### This is the eleventh of twelve projects for the 🏡 Treehouse Techdegree Full Stack JavaScript.
Currently a WIP. 

This is a REST API that uses Express. It provides a way for users to review courses. Users can see a list of courses in a database; add courses to the database; and add reviews for a specific course.

You'll need to make a `config.js` file with contents that look like this:
``` 
module.exports = {
  secret: "its free real estate"
}; 
```

`npm i` to install dependences, then `npm start` to run.
