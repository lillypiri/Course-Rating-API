#### Project 11

## Course Rating API 📚

###### This is the eleventh of twelve projects for the 🏡 Treehouse Techdegree Full Stack JavaScript.
Currently a WIP. 

This is a REST API that uses Express. It provides a way for users to review courses. Users can see a list of courses in a database; add courses to the database; and add reviews for a specific course.

`npm i` to install dependences, then `npm start` to run.
